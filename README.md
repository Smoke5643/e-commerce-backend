## Description of project


This E-commerce Back End application was designed to manage and supply data from a database about a companies products. The app allows data to be viewed, entered, modified, and/or deleted from the ecommerce database.

 ## Installation

  This app is used for back end only with no webpage associated.  The application is currently set up in a way that it must be interfaced through a program such as Insomnia. These programs allow a user to create GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. If you too want to run the app on your local machine, you will need to install Insomnia. Next, visit https://github.com/smoke5643/e-commerce-backend to clone the repository to your local machine. Then run a few simple commands to get started: 
  ```
  npm i
  npm run env:copy 
  npm run db:sync
  npm run seed
  npm run start
  ```
